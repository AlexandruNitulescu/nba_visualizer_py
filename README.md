## Overview

This project demonstrates my proficiency in data processing and database management, which are essential skills for data analysts and data scientists. By using Python and SQL, I was able to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets and design efficient database structures that enable easy querying and management.

## Data Processing

To process the data, I used Python to clean and manipulate the data in a way that would make it easy to work with. This involved:

- Converting data types
- Splitting columns into multiple columns
- Creating new calculated columns
- Merging datasets together

By using pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python, I was able to perform all of these tasks quickly and efficiently.

## Database Management

Once the data was cleaned and processed, I created a database to store it in using SQLite. I designed the database schema in a way that would minimize redundancy and make querying the data as easy as possible.

To achieve this, I used the following techniques:

- Creating normalized tables to minimize redundancy
- Creating relationships between tables to join them together efficiently
- Indexing key columns to speed up queries
- Using appropriate data types to minimize storage space

By following these best practices for database design, I was able to create a database that was both efficient and easy to use.

## Conclusion

By combining my skills in data processing and database management, I was able to create a powerful tool for analyzing and querying large datasets. Whether you're looking to extract insights from a complex dataset or build a robust database to store your data, I have the skills necessary to get the job done.
